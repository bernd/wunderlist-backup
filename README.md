# wunderlist-backup

Backup your [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com/) data into a JSON file.

This script produces similar output to the backup files generated by the
Wunderlist web application export feature.

## Requirements

Ruby >= 2.0 (no extra gems needed)

## Usage

You have to [create an application](https://developer.wunderlist.com/apps/new)
in Wunderlist to get access to the required OAUTH data for authentication.

![Create Wunderlist App](/images/create-app.png)

After that you see the "Client ID" and "Client Secret". Now you have to
generate an access token.

![Create Wunderlist Token](/images/create-token.png)

Store that token in a secure location, it's only shown once!

Now you have to set two environment variables to allow the backup script to
access the Wunderlist API. After doing that, just run the script.

Example:

```
$ export WUNDERLIST_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your Wunderlist access token>
$ export WUNDERLIST_CLIENT_ID=<your Wunderlist client id>
$ ruby wunderlist-backup.rb > wunderlist-backup.json
```
